				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab remains that my code is iffy 
					about working and the buttons aren't fully functioning</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I am struggling with even the file organization from week to week as well as the jquery. 
					I am doing my best to replicate past labs where the file strucure did work to do as much as I can.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am physically and mentally struggling outside of class and so I am struggling in 
					this class. I am proud of myself for the patterns and code knowledge I am gaining 
					though...even if my code doesn't always work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The button showed up on the page! And my page was published for lab 11. I am proud of this 
					because in past weeks this has not been the case...
				</p>
