				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I am trying to make my lab css link to show up on my page and wesbot took me through
					a variety of troubleshooting actions. However, I am still struggling with having it 
					link correcty, even though my code seems to be written correcty.
					I am also struggling with the JS showing up on my page. Again, it looks correct to me and 
					I checked it with the code on the assignment as well as wesbot and ChatGBT for errors and 
					fixed all the eorrs when writing my code.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I feel proud of myslef for continuing on even when I feel so lost with coding.
					And I am picking up some things as I go.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>All my code is written and file strucutre made. It doesn't seem to be linking to my 
					site though.</p>
