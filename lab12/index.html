				<p>Create a code with conditionals that sorts Harry Potter houses</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I am trying to make my lab CSS link show up on my page. Although it looks correct, I'm still having trouble with it linking properly. I also checked my JavaScript, but it isnâ€™t showing up on the page despite looking correct.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I feel proud of myself for continuing on even when I feel so lost with coding, and I am learning more as I go.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>All my code is written and my file structure created, but it doesn't seem to be linking to my site yet.</p>
