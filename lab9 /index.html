                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>I am struggling with having deleted my homepage on accident as well as having deleted lab 9
                    folders. My lab 9 page also is not loading even though it is linked in my greater index.html file. 
                </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had to figure out how to troubleshoot and solve having deleted fundamental parts of my site and 
                    restore them through github. I worked backwards and tried to re-build my files on VS code. I am also just 
                    generally struggling with understnading the jquery parts and not really sure where to go with this.
                </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> I am trying my best to do what I can to organize my work, troubleshoot my problems, and check with wesbot and 
                    chatGBT when I have questions. My partners have been MIA and I haven't been able to have extra support.
