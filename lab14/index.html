            <h1>Lab 14: Debugging</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
   			 <p>The challenge of this lab was debugging a past lab.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I have been struggling with my file structure and none of my code working and I was able to fix lab 8 by fixing
                my file structure and links in my index.html.
			</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The code works correctly for lab 8!
			</p>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>I am happy to better understand the file structure and what it means to link the code!
			</p>
            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>I went back to lab 8 where none of my code was working at I was receiving 404 error codes.
                I was able to fix my file strucutre within VS code and make it so my css and JS were correctly linked within my
                index.html for lab 8. I was able to test these changes and see the design of my page change, the links work correctly,
                and view the JS code in the console with a button.
            </p>
