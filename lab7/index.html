                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to work on creating a file struture in VS as well as making functions in JavaScript.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I intitaly had problems with creating my file structure and had to look back at past labs and make mistakes in my organization. I am also struggling with keeping up with arrays, objects, and functions because I barely understand css or html either. I am doing my best to watch the lectures, ask wesbot and chatGBT more specific questions when I am confused, and look at past labs for guidance. </p>
