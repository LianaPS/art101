					<h2>About Me!</h2>
					<p>Hi, my name is Liana. I am from San Diego and sometimes I miss the warmth living up here. 
						I love swimming in the ocean, especialy when the water is clear. 
						I like things that look golden but I also like silver when it comes to metal. 
						I make most of my art in the physical and find myself regularly stumped  
						when it comes to technology...even printing poses a challenge.  </p>
