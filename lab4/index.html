			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was deciding how speciifc to be with the pseudocode. Additionally, I am having some trouble with the formatting of my "comments" and understanding where hava script is involved in index.html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My partner and I worked together to figure out the best way to list out our pseudocode and there were times when we were stuck but we made decisions and added to each other's ideas where there were missing parts and that is how we solved this issue.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I am getting somewhat more comfortable with using VS code and github and navigating between the two on my screens which was very challenging for me the first couple time!</p>
