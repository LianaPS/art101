                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to continue defining variables and try to learn how to use objects and arrays in our code.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I am still struggling with the basics of coding. I don't fully comprehend what an object or array is. I am trying to learn from the lecture, re-watching, ChatGPT, Wesbot, and W3 Schools. It is just challenging because it feels like I am reading in a different language that I do not know.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This assignment has gone okay. I have been very overwhelmed this week, so I am struggling with focusing, but given that, I am proud of myself for organizing my time and energy to work on this, even when it is really challenging to do so.</p>
