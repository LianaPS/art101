					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab is getting my image of myself to show up on my page.
						I trouble shootted with my partner's code, with wesbot, and with the inspect part of my page. This is tedious work and it is challening for me~
						 .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main issue is troubleshooting issues with my code and not really being sure what to do after I get so stuck. 
						I am unable to see the image on my page even after doing extensive checking as to why this is the issue. I also have some code showing
						up directly on my website that I can not seem to change. I have swtiched browers, had my partner read my code, read my partner's working code,
						checked with wesbot, and I am still unable to solve these issues. I was able to troubleshoot more in my in person section and 
						Diego sat with me and looked through my code for index.html and lab 3 and helped me figure out why my images were not showing up, 
						showed me how to format them in html, and showed me some shortcuts for saving my work and viewing it. I was able to finally see my images
						and I feel so thankful for the help!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel so overwhelmed and confused. I feel like I have so little grasp on coding and it makes it so that
						when I try to troubleshoot I can't even figure out the basics. Update: I feel better after receving help from my peer and I 
					want to continue having time to work in in person section to help figure out what I am having trouble grasping.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My website is mostly working! The css is working and most of my code is showing up! Update: I was able to fix what I messed up on
						and feel like I learned something today.
						 </p>
