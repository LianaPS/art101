			<h1>Lab X - Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab is getting my image of myself to show up on my page.
						I trouble shootted with my partner's code, with wesbot, and with the inspect part of my page.
						 However, the image still will not load. I am unsure of what to do!.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main issue is troubleshooting issues with my code and not really being sure what to do after I get so stuck. 
						I am unable to see the image on my page even after doing extensive checking as to why this is the issue. I also have some code showing
						up directly on my website that I can not seem to change. I have swtiched browers, had my partner read my code, read my partner's working code,
						checked with wesbot, and I am still unable to solve these issues.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel so overwhelmed and confused. I feel like I have so little grasp on coding and it makes it so that
						when I try to troubleshoot I can't even figure out the basics </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My website is mostly working! The css is working and most of my code is showing up!
						 I am still proud even though it is imperfect.</p>
