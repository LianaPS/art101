                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab has been linking my JavaScript to my HTML so that it shows up in the console on my page. I think overall it has been challenging going from HTML, CSS, and now JS so quickly. I do not really have a great grasp on any.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I am coming across the issue of linking the code in my JS directory to my HTML to show up on my page. I have asked Wesbot as well as ChatGPT to see where I am going wrong, but it appears that it should be working. I will continue testing. I am still struggling with linking the css to html but was able to figure it out with the help of wesbot. I am additionally struggling with my images not showing up even when linked in my index.html. I plan to ask a peer in section.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This assignment went fairly smoothly. I feel like I am getting some grasp of these applications as well as some idea of how to ask questions in order to get better answers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The results of this lab are that I was able to figure out how to link the variables from my JS to my index.html. I am proud of this! I feel like I am navigating coding just the tiniest bit better. I was also able to link my css to my index.html and it showed up on my website. I am still waiting for assistance in figuring out why my image is not showing up on my page! I will check with a friend in section. :</p>
