					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab has been linking my Javascript to my HTML so that it shows up in the console on my page.
					I think overall it has been challenging going from html, css, and now JS so quickly. I do not really have a great grasp on any.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I am coming across the issue of linking the code in my JS directory to my HTML to show up on my page. I have asked wesbot as well as chatgbt to see where I am going wrong but it appears that it should be working. I will continue testing. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
