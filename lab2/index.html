			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My partner and I worked on this for hours. 
						We are struggling to see the changes on our website, even while using Wesbot to check our codes. 
						Wesbot said our CSS and our html codes should work and we are unsure of why they aren't linking, 
						even when we follow the steps..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Quite a few problems came up, like not understanding the html tags and also our code not synching to our 
						websites. We troubleshotted with one another as well as Wesbot to try and find an answer, 
						but we haven't figured it out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We are both struggling with this assignment and feel very confused about the basics of html and css. 
						We felt like we had an ok grasp of the lecture but when we are off on our own we don't even know what 
						to look up in order to ask questions/where to begin troubleshooting. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> We have many steps of our attemps at coding and our troubleshooting. The results of this assignment 
						are that we learned how to more closelsy read, compare, and write code and beign troubleshooting issues.
						 We also have the result of the code not synching to our website and we are stuck at that point.</p>
